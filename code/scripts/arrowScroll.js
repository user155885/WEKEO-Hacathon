// several rules for arrows:

/*
idea logic:
    1. arrows are invisible by default
    2. the "left-arrow" button first time appears only when "join" button is clicked on the first page
    3. the "right-arrow" button first time appears only when "left-arrow" button is clicked on any page
    4. once ane arrow has appeared is does never disappear
    5. however, on the first page the "left-arrow" button may never display as well as "right-arrow" button should disappear when the user has reached the last page of the website
    6. when hovering over any arrow button it should increase in size (transform: scale())

implementation logic:
    1. all arrows have style 'hidden' for invisibility and non-interactivity
